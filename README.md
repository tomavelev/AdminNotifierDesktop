This is a toy project for monitoring different stuff on my server - remaining space, number of food items, number of messages, number of not-build data models, etc (whatever your domain area is). 

It is build with the help of my [https://tomavelev.com/GeneratorApp](https://tomavelev.com/GeneratorApp) tool with some small modification of the generated code.

To create an executable jar - just execute "(mvn/maven) clean compile assembly:single"
